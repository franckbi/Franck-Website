# ADR 007: Implement strict performance budgets

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The portfolio website includes 3D graphics and interactive features that could negatively impact performance. We need to establish and enforce performance budgets to ensure good user experience across all devices.

Performance goals:

- Lighthouse Performance score ≥ 90
- First Contentful Paint (FCP) ≤ 1.5s
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) ≤ 2.5s
- Time to Interactive (TTI) ≤ 3.0s
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) ≤ 0.1

## Decision

We will implement strict performance budgets enforced through automated testing and CI/CD pipeline failures.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **User Experience** - Consistent fast loading across all devices
- **SEO Benefits** - Better search engine rankings
- **Conversion Rates** - Improved user engagement and retention
- **Mobile Performance** - Optimized for mobile and slow connections
- **Cost Efficiency** - Reduced bandwidth and hosting costs
- **Quality Assurance** - Prevents performance regressions

### Negative

- **Development Constraints** - May limit feature implementation
- **Build Complexity** - Additional build steps and monitoring
- **False Positives** - CI failures due to temporary performance issues
- **Maintenance Overhead** - Regular budget adjustments needed

### Budget Specifications

#### Bundle Size Budgets

- **JavaScript (excluding Three.js)** - ≤ 180KB gzipped
- **CSS** - ≤ 50KB gzipped
- **3D Assets (initial load)** - ≤ 1.2MB total
- **Images (above fold)** - ≤ 500KB total

#### Runtime Performance Budgets

- **FPS (3D scenes)** - ≥ 30fps on mid-range mobile
- **Memory Usage** - ≤ 100MB for 3D scenes
- **Network Requests** - ≤ 20 requests for initial load
- **Time to Interactive** - ≤ 2.5s on 4G connection

#### Core Web Vitals Budgets

- **LCP** - ≤ 2.5s (Good)
- **FID** - ≤ 100ms (Good)
- **CLS** - ≤ 0.1 (Good)

### Enforcement Strategy

- **CI/CD Integration** - Build fails if budgets exceeded
- **Lighthouse CI** - Automated performance testing
- **Bundle Analysis** - Regular bundle size monitoring
- **Real User Monitoring** - Production performance tracking
- **Performance Reviews** - Regular budget assessment and adjustment
