# ADR 003: Implement progressive enhancement for 3D features

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The portfolio website features interactive 3D scenes, but we need to ensure accessibility and performance across all devices and user preferences. Some users may have:

- Devices without WebGL support
- Low-power devices with limited GPU capabilities
- Accessibility needs requiring reduced motion
- Preference for simpler interfaces

## Decision

We will implement a progressive enhancement strategy with multiple fallback layers:

1. **Base Layer** - Semantic HTML and CSS (works without JavaScript)
2. **Enhanced Layer** - Interactive features with JavaScript
3. **3D Layer** - Full WebGL rendering for capable devices
4. **Fallback Layer** - Static images and simplified interactions

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Universal Accessibility** - Works for all users regardless of device capabilities
- **Performance** - Optimal experience for each device class
- **SEO Benefits** - Content accessible to search engines without JavaScript
- **User Choice** - Low-power mode toggle for battery conservation
- **Resilience** - Graceful degradation when features fail

### Negative

- **Development Complexity** - Multiple code paths to maintain
- **Testing Overhead** - Need to test all enhancement layers
- **Bundle Size** - Additional code for fallback scenarios
- **Design Constraints** - 3D features must have meaningful 2D equivalents

### Implementation Details

- **WebGL Detection** - Check capabilities before loading 3D assets
- **Performance Monitoring** - Adaptive quality based on device performance
- **User Preferences** - Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` and provide manual toggles
- **Semantic Equivalents** - Ensure 3D content has accessible alternatives
- **Error Boundaries** - Graceful fallback when 3D rendering fails
