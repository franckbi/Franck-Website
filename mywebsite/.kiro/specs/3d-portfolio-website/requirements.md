# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a modern 3D portfolio website built with Three.js via react-three-fiber. The portfolio will serve as a professional showcase targeting recruiters, engineering managers, and potential clients. The core value proposition is to quickly communicate skills and projects through an interactive 3D scene that degrades gracefully to 2D for accessibility and performance.

The website will feature a "Studio in the Cloud" concept with a minimalist 3D desk scene containing floating project cards, comprehensive project browsing capabilities, and robust fallback mechanisms for various device capabilities and user preferences.

## Requirements

5. WHEN Low-Power mode is enabled THEN the system SHALL default to list view for optimal performance
6. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL allow tabbing through all project items and filter controls

### Requirement 3: Detailed Project Presentation

**User Story:** As a visitor, I want to view comprehensive project details including media, technical information, and links, so that I can evaluate the developer's work quality and technical expertise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing a project detail page THEN the system SHALL display hero media, summary, role, tech stack chips, markdown body, gallery, and relevant links
2. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL achieve Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) under 2.5 seconds on 4G connections
3. WHEN images are displayed THEN the system SHALL use responsive images with srcset and lazy loading
4. WHEN viewing the gallery THEN the system SHALL support both images and videos with appropriate controls
5. WHEN accessing call-to-action buttons THEN the system SHALL provide clear "Try Demo" and "View Code" options where applicable
6. WHEN using assistive technology THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate alt text and semantic markup for all content

### Requirement 4: Performance and Accessibility Standards

**User Story:** As a user with varying device capabilities and accessibility needs, I want the website to perform well and be fully accessible, so that I can have a positive experience regardless of my device or abilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the initial page loads THEN the system SHALL deliver JavaScript payload ≤ 180 KB gzipped (excluding three.js core shared chunk)
2. WHEN 3D content loads for the first time THEN the system SHALL limit total payload to ≤ 1.2 MB including models and textures
3. WHEN Time to Interactive is measured THEN the system SHALL achieve TTI < 2.5 seconds on mid-range mobile devices
4. WHEN prefers-reduced-motion is detected THEN the system SHALL disable camera drift and reduce postprocessing effects
5. WHEN using keyboard navigation THEN the system SHALL provide skip-to-content links and proper focus management
6. WHEN screen readers are used THEN the system SHALL provide ARIA labels for 3D triggers and semantic equivalents outside canvas
7. WHEN Low-Power mode is toggled THEN the system SHALL reduce JavaScript payload by at least 120KB and persist the setting

### Requirement 5: Content Management and SEO

**User Story:** As a site owner, I want the website to be discoverable by search engines and easily maintainable, so that it can effectively serve as a professional portfolio and attract opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN search engines crawl the site THEN the system SHALL provide proper meta tags, Open Graph data, and JSON-LD Person + Project schema
2. WHEN projects are added or updated THEN the system SHALL support a structured content model with slug, title, description, tech stack, and media
3. WHEN the sitemap is generated THEN the system SHALL include all public pages with proper canonical URLs
4. WHEN social media previews are generated THEN the system SHALL display appropriate images and descriptions
5. WHEN content is rendered THEN the system SHALL provide semantic HTML structure that mirrors 3D content for accessibility
6. WHEN robots.txt is accessed THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate crawling instructions

### Requirement 6: User Interaction and Communication

**User Story:** As a potential client or employer, I want to easily contact the developer and learn about their background, so that I can initiate professional conversations or collaborations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the about page THEN the system SHALL display bio, skills matrix, timeline, and resume link from structured data
2. WHEN using the contact form THEN the system SHALL validate inputs both client-side and server-side with spam protection
3. WHEN submitting the contact form THEN the system SHALL send emails via API and provide clear success/error feedback
4. WHEN form validation fails THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages for each field
5. WHEN the contact API is called THEN the system SHALL implement rate limiting and input sanitization
6. WHEN personal information is handled THEN the system SHALL comply with privacy best practices and avoid PII logging

### Requirement 7: Theme and Personalization

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize my viewing experience with theme and performance options, so that the website works optimally for my preferences and device capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN theme toggle is used THEN the system SHALL switch between light and dark modes and persist the preference
2. WHEN Low-Power toggle is activated THEN the system SHALL disable 3D rendering and use static alternatives
3. WHEN settings are changed THEN the system SHALL store preferences in localStorage for future visits
4. WHEN the page loads THEN the system SHALL respect system preferences for color scheme and reduced motion
