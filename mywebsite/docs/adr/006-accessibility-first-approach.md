# ADR 006: Adopt accessibility-first development approach

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The portfolio website features innovative 3D interactions that could potentially exclude users with disabilities. We need to ensure the site is fully accessible while maintaining the engaging 3D experience.

Accessibility requirements:

- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard navigation support
- Reduced motion preferences
- Color contrast standards
- Focus management

## Decision

We will adopt an accessibility-first development approach where accessibility considerations drive design and implementation decisions, not retrofitted afterward.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Inclusive Design** - Website works for all users regardless of abilities
- **Legal Compliance** - Meets accessibility regulations and standards
- **SEO Benefits** - Semantic HTML improves search engine understanding
- **Better UX** - Accessibility improvements often benefit all users
- **Future-proof** - Prepared for evolving accessibility standards
- **Brand Value** - Demonstrates commitment to inclusive design

### Negative

- **Development Time** - Additional time for accessibility testing and implementation
- **Design Constraints** - Some visual designs may need modification
- **Testing Complexity** - Need specialized testing tools and techniques
- **Performance Impact** - Additional markup and ARIA attributes

### Implementation Strategy

- **Semantic HTML** - Use proper HTML elements and structure
- **ARIA Labels** - Comprehensive labeling for 3D interactions
- **Keyboard Navigation** - Full keyboard accessibility for all features
- **Screen Reader Support** - Alternative text and descriptions for 3D content
- **Focus Management** - Proper focus indicators and logical tab order
- **Reduced Motion** - Respect user preferences and provide toggles
- **Color Contrast** - Ensure sufficient contrast in all themes
- **Testing Integration** - Automated accessibility testing in CI/CD pipeline
