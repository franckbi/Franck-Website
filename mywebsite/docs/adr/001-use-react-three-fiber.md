# ADR 001: Use react-three-fiber for 3D rendering

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The portfolio website requires interactive 3D scenes to showcase projects in an engaging way. We need to choose a 3D rendering solution that integrates well with React while providing good performance and developer experience.

Options considered:

1. **Vanilla Three.js** - Direct Three.js integration with React refs
2. **react-three-fiber** - React renderer for Three.js
3. **Babylon.js** - Alternative 3D engine with React integration
4. **A-Frame** - Web-based VR framework

## Decision

We will use react-three-fiber (@react-three/fiber) along with the drei (@react-three/drei) helper library for 3D rendering.

## Consequences

### Positive

- **React Integration** - Declarative 3D scenes using JSX syntax
- **Component Reusability** - 3D objects as React components
- **Ecosystem** - Rich ecosystem with drei helpers and postprocessing
- **Performance** - Automatic disposal and memory management
- **Developer Experience** - Hot reload, debugging tools, and TypeScript support
- **Community** - Active community and extensive documentation

### Negative

- **Learning Curve** - Developers need to learn both React and Three.js concepts
- **Bundle Size** - Additional abstraction layer adds some overhead
- **Debugging** - Some Three.js debugging tools may not work directly
- **Flexibility** - Some advanced Three.js features may require escape hatches

### Mitigation Strategies

- Provide comprehensive documentation and examples
- Use code splitting to minimize bundle impact
- Implement performance monitoring to catch issues early
- Create utility functions for common Three.js operations
